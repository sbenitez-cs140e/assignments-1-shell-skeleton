The last line of the main() function uses a mutable borrow, while y is also an
active borrow.

Since mutable references must be the only active aliases to the referenced
resource, we need to make sure any other aliases are dead.

The easiest way to do this is to limit the scope of y, which holds the other
reference to x.
