By default, a struct has move semantics.
If the struct has move semantics, then the code would be incorrect because x is moved to y, but then is moved again from x to z.
If the struct is just Copy, then the compiler complains it doesn't have Clone, because the impl Copy requires Clone to be implemented.

In the example both traits were derived, removing either one or both makes the code not compile.
