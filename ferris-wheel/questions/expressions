max(a, b) needs to be using generics since it's called with u8, usize and IntWrapper() types.
T type of the parameters need to be PartialOrd to be able to compare them to return the max.
T also needs to be PartialEq since assert_eq! relies on it.

The 'use' restriction applies only to when max is called with IntWrapper types, since u8 and usize are Copy.
Easiest fix is to clone IntWrapper when calling max().
