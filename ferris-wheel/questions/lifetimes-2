struct RefWrapper:
 - Inner type '&'a T' should have a lifetime as long as it container, but RefWrapper<T> didn't declare a struct lifetime.
 - Added generic subtype restriction (<'a, ..>) and lifetime subtype T relative to lifetime 'a: <'a, T:'a>.

 impl block:
 - didn't actually refer to type RefWrapper<'a, T>
 - aslo didn't decalre any lifetime, although it was expected inner() would return a lifetiem at least as long as the container
 - Added:
   - declaration of lifime <'a> for impl block
   - lifetime subtyping for inner type "T: 'a"
   - liftime 'a to the returned type from inner call ("&'a T" instead of &T)
